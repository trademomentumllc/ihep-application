## TIMELINE STRUCTURE

This document traces the creative development of IHEP in **five phases**:

**Phase 0**: Pre-Documentation (Conceptual Gestation)  
**Phase I**: Vision Documentation (November 2025)  
**Phase II**: Technical Architecture (November-December 2025)  
**Phase III**: Funding & Partnerships (December 2025)  
**Phase IV**: Provenance Documentation (December 9-10, 2025)

---

## PHASE 0: PRE-DOCUMENTATION CONCEPTUAL GESTATION

**Period**: Unknown → November 2025  
**Key Activity**: Jason conceptualizes IHEP vision

### The Genesis Question

> "What if healthcare technology could serve two masters simultaneously - providing immediate patient value while building the data infrastructure for breakthrough cure research?"

This question represents the **intellectual seed** that grew into IHEP.

### Influences and Inspirations (Inferred)

1. **Personal Experience**: Likely direct or indirect exposure to HIV care system gaps
2. **Healthcare Frustration**: Witnessing 40% post-diagnosis dropout rate
3. **Technology Awareness**: Understanding that AI + cloud computing enable previously impossible coordination
4. **Systems Thinking**: Recognizing that health = clinical + behavioral + social + financial
5. **Mission Alignment**: Commitment to health equity as foundational value, not afterthought

### Key Decisions Made in This Phase

- ✅ **Target HIV/AIDS** as initial condition (largest care cascade gaps, most data)
- ✅ **Start with underserved communities** (Miami, Orlando, LA, NYC)
- ✅ **Integrate financial empowerment** as clinical intervention
- ✅ **Design for cure research**, not just care management
- ✅ **Pursue non-dilutive funding first** (SBIR/STTR, foundations)

**Evidence**: These themes appear consistently across all November-December 2025 documents, indicating pre-documentation strategic clarity.

## PHASE I: VISION DOCUMENTATION (NOVEMBER 2025)

### Week 1: Initial Engagement with AI (Claude)

**Estimated Date**: Early November 2025

**Jason's First Requests** (reconstructed from document patterns):
1. "Help me document a comprehensive digital health platform for HIV care"
2. "I need architecture that's HIPAA-compliant from Day 1"
3. "This has to address clinical, behavioral, social, AND financial health"
4. "Can you create investor materials that explain the cure acceleration opportunity?"

**AI Response**: Began generating technical specifications, market analysis, regulatory compliance frameworks

**Key Insight**: Jason came prepared with **strategic vision already formed**. AI role was **translation and amplification**, not ideation.

**Document**: `README.md`  
**Purpose**: Production-ready technical specification

**Jason's Vision Translated to Code**:

| **Jason's Concept** | **AI's Implementation** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| "Four-twin architecture" | PostgreSQL schemas, FHIR integration, microservices |
| "Sub-200ms response time" | Redis L2 cache, Cloud Run autoscaling |
| "14-nines PHI protection" | Envelope encryption (P_breach = 10^-20) |
| "Financial health as treatment" | Financial Twin Service (8 API endpoints) |
| "Morphogenetic self-healing" | Reaction-diffusion PDE implementation |
| "Federated AI learning" | Vertex AI pipeline with differential privacy |

**Technology Stack** (selected by AI based on Jason's requirements):
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask, FastAPI), Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Google Healthcare API (FHIR)

### December 1, 2025: System Architecture Document

**Documents**: 
- `IHEP-system-architecture.docx` (23 pages)
- `IHEP-PROJECT-CHARTER.docx` (63 pages)

**Jason's Focus**: "Show me how everything fits together - security, data flow, compliance, governance"

**Key Innovations Documented**:
1. **Seven-Layer Security Model**: DDoS → WAF → LB → IAM → mTLS → Encryption → Audit
2. **Zero Trust IAM**: Trust score T(u,r,t) = Σ w_i * i_i (calculated on every request)
3. **Merkle Tree Integrity**: P_tamper = 2^-5120 for audit logs
4. **CUSUM Anomaly Detection**: Real-time monitoring with ARL = 1000
5. **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving cross-site training

**Mathematical Rigor**: Every security claim backed by probability calculations:
- P_breach = 10^-20 (envelope encryption + Merkle trees)
- P_injection < 10^-9 (WAF rules)
- P_false_denial < 10^-6 (Zero Trust IAM)
