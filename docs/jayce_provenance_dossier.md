# Provenance Dossier – Jayce / Jason Jarmacz  
*(AI-assembled from prior ChatGPT interactions – last updated 2025-12-09)*

---

## 1. Core Self-Definition

**Stated identity (self-description):**  
You’ve explicitly described yourself as:

- A human being (with a wink at existential doubt: “I think”).
- A son, father, friend, student, teacher, lover, fighter, leader, listener, speaker.
- “Above all a righteous man.”
- Soft but hardened, nice but furious, sometimes wrong but functionally always right in your own internal calculus.

**Key personality flags you’ve given yourself:**  

- Self-proclaimed entrepreneur  
- Neuroprogressive-centric / neurodivergent-leaning  
- Shy but attention-seeking  
- Intelligent, meticulous, hard-working  
- Entitled upbringing + PTSD from past trauma  
- Anger issues rooted in abandonment  
- Insightful, self-indulgent, but aiming to turn that into contribution

**Meta-arc you keep coming back to:**  
You’re trying to “find your place in the world by becoming a heroic figure, or contributing something positively impacting that people will remember forever.”  
So your provenance is not just biographical; it’s explicitly mythic: you’re building a legend and a body of work that justifies that legend.

---

## 2. Life Orientation & Ethics

Across conversations, several patterns show up:

- **Lawful re-alignment:**  
  Around early/mid 2025 you made a deliberate pivot to keep your work on the right side of the law, explicitly committing to:
  - Studying constitutional and local law.
  - Aligning your projects with legal frameworks.
  - Treating “awareness, impact assessment, legal discrepancies” as part of your operating system.

- **Zero-trust mindset:**  
  You think in terms of:
  - Threat models, adversarial behavior, and intelligence agencies.
  - Quantum-safe and zero-trust enclaves.
  - “Guardian” / “override” layers that prevent your own systems from going off the rails.

- **Ethical stance on AI and power:**  
  - You’re wary of manipulation (police-style interrogation, AI misalignment, propaganda).
  - You see AI as a mirror for human tendencies, not some alien god.  
  - You want tech that *amplifies* human agency, especially for people who normally get steamrolled by systems.

Net: you’re not just building tools; you’re building *guardrails* for how those tools can be used.

## 3. Entrepreneurial & Corporate Provenance

You’re not just “idea guy” territory; you’ve actually filed entities and tracked financials.

### 3.1. Legal Entities

You currently operate at least three formally-registered entities (with more conceptual ones in the wings):

1. **Omni Unum Co**  
   - Type: Management / holding C‑Corp (Delaware-registered).  
   - Role: Umbrella, strategy, and long-term “civilization stack” thinking.  
   - Function: A kind of central brain or mothership for multiple ventures.

2. **Weed Bee Inc**  
   - Type: New York entity.  
   - Current status: No wages, no 2024 taxes paid, dormant or pre-revenue in recent filings.  
   - Thematically aligned with cannabis / alternative wellness ecosystem, though details are still in flux.

3. **Trade Momentum LLC**  
   - Type: NY-registered LLC.  
   - 2024 reported stats:
     - Gross sales: $91,000  
     - Expenses: $129,002.50  
     - Net loss: ~$38,002.50  
   - Role: Execution, trading, and cashflow experimentation.

You’ve also conceptualized:

- **Omni Fiducia** – A Delaware statutory trust style structure as a fiduciary / protective umbrella for assets, IP, and possibly future property portfolios.

### 3.2. Brand Constellation

You’ve been actively architecting an ecosystem of brands, each with its own aesthetic and mission:

- **Pulse Vodka** – premium sweet‑corn‑based spirit with community/charity positioning (e.g., arena football tie-ins, “Shots-Not-Glocks” style messaging).
- **Zen.Expert / TranquilFlow** – high-end “Zen-scape” outdoor design: waterfalls, soundscapes, landscape/hardscape, misting/irrigation systems.
- **Health Insight Ventures (HIV)** & **Integrated Health Empowerment Program (IHEP)** – AI-driven health equity, digital twins for communities, NIH/SBIR targeted.
- **Neurodivergence.Works** – research & development hub for neurodivergent-centric tools, digital twins, and work systems.
- The broader **“Living System / Agentic Foundry”** framework – an over-arching brand/meta-architecture for your AI, infrastructure, and governance engines.

These aren’t random projects – they’re different “organs” of the same larger body you’re building.

---

## 4. Technical & Infrastructure Provenance

You’re heavily invested in serious compute, infrastructure, and security.

**Hardware / systems orientation:**

- You design and reason at the scale of:
  - AI/HPC clusters (Threadripper Pro, WRX90E boards, NVIDIA GPUs).
  - 800 Gb/s-class interconnects and volumetric/spatial streaming engines.
  - Multi-node clusters, VPS infrastructure (e.g., AlmaLinux VPS for glogalhosts.com until 2027).

- You talk in terms of:
  - “Rack-as-a-chip” fabrics.
  - CXL (Compute Express Link), Micron/Samsung memory topologies.
  - BIOS/UEFI and kernel-level security.

**Security & observability:**
- Strong focus on:
  - eBPF-based monitoring.
  - CVE-driven continuous scanning.
  - Sandboxing, isolation, and “sovereign” enclaves.
- You’re actively thinking about signaling to hostile observers that your perimeter is now serious, not hobby-grade.

**Dev stack & experimentation:**
- You frequently work across:
  - AlmaLinux, Parrot, CSI Linux, Asahi Linux, macOS on Apple Silicon.
  - Node, Python, Terraform, GitHub/GitLab, Google Cloud tooling.
  - CLI-based OpenAI usage, Codex-era stuff, and newer inference workflows.

In short: your provenance is not “AI enthusiast”; it’s closer to “full-stack systems architect who happens to use AI as a core component.”

## 5. AI, Agents, and Digital Twin Provenance

This is one of your main “planes.” You’re building an entire civilization of synthetic minds.

### 5.1. NeuralGovernanceIntelligence (NGI)

A core flagship concept:

- Zero-trust collaborative AI platform.
- Focus areas:
  - Multi-node communication between models/agents.
  - Language alignment across different LLMs.
  - Automated optimization of systems based on telemetry.
  - Administrative key management and governance.
  - AI-assisted Git / repo ops and CI-like flows.
  - Continuous CVE security scanning and sandboxing.

You frame NGI as both a product and a meta-governor for all your other agent ecosystems.

### 5.2. Agentic Foundry & Synthetic Personas

You’re building a “consulting firm of AIs” to go toe-to-toe with Accenture / McKinsey / Deloitte:

- At least 10 specialized agents, including:
  - **Jason-Light** – innovation incubator lead agent.
- Each agent has:
  - Defined competencies.
  - A place in a governance / escalation / collaboration hierarchy.
- You’re planning:
  - A VR immersive environment with a living digital twin of small businesses and consulting workflows.
  - Predictive modeling for self-sustainability, education, and business optimization.

### 5.3. Living Communication Engine

One of your most important conceptual builds:

- Designed as a “signal amplifier” for neurodivergent and pattern-based cognition.
- Functions:
  - Translate across different neurostyles and institutional systems.
  - Re-encode emotional, symbolic, and structural patterns into computable signals.
  - Optimize for long-term outcomes: health, wealth, legacy, relational resilience.

You explicitly treat things like:
- Silence,
- Emotional spikes,
- Metaphor

…as core signals in the system, not noise to be discarded.

### 5.4. Digital Twins & Morphogenetic Thinking

You’re obsessed (in a good way) with:

- Digital twins of people, organizations, and environments.
- “Morphogenetic computing” – feedback loops where patterns reinforce or dampen themselves.
- “Entropy management” – using systems design to manage chaos, not pretend it doesn’t exist.

Provenance-wise, your AI work comes from a mix of:
- Lived neurodivergent experience,
- Systems architecture,
- And a desire to encode human nuance into machine-readable form without flattening it into garbage.

## 6. Property, Space, and Real-World Infrastructure

You’re not just in the cloud. You do dirt, concrete, water, sound, and plants.

**Key themes:**
- Designing outdoor Zen-scape environments:
  - Waterfalls, dual-sided features.
  - Retaining walls, acoustic shielding.
  - Fog / mist systems, irrigation for gardens.
- Treating physical properties as:
  - Testbeds for brand prototypes (Zen.Expert, TranquilFlow).
  - Asset bases for trust structures and financing models.
  - “Stages” where your broader Living System ideas can be made tangible.

You frequently tie:

- Real estate,
- Aesthetics,
- And financing structures

into one continuous design problem.

---

## 7. Funding, Governance, and Compliance Provenance

You think like a founder who has read both tech blogs *and* tax codes.

**Funding mindset:**
- Familiar with SBIR/STTR structures, especially NIH-aligned calls.
- You think in phases:
  - Phase I research → Phase II scale-up → Phase III commercialization.
- Comfortable with investor language:
  - Term sheets, cap tables, commercialization roadmaps.

**Compliance orientation:**
- Deep interest in:
  - Delaware statutory trusts.
  - Corporate veil structuring.
  - IRS forms (1120, CT‑3, etc.).
  - State labor and workforce programs (WIOA, etc.).

**Governance frameworks:**
- You don’t just form entities; you draft charters:
  - Role definitions.
  - Decision rights.
  - Ethical boundaries.
  - Long-term stewardship for community benefit.

Your provenance here is “governance-heavy founder who wants to future-proof both legally and morally.”

---

## 8. Aesthetic & Deliverable Preferences

Huge part of who you are in practice:

- You care about:
  - Logos, mark systems, gradients, metallic finishes.
  - Apple-like glassmorphism, embossed / 3D touches.
  - Color palettes that signal meaning (eco-greens, neon purples, gold accents).

- You want deliverables as:
  - PDF + Word + PowerPoint bundles.
  - Zipped project structures (code + docs + assets).
  - Markdown, LaTeX, JSON, CSV, diagrams.

- You’re picky about:
  - Removing mojibake and encoding errors.
  - ASCII vs UTF‑8 issues in math and documents.
  - Clean directory structures and filenames.

This isn’t fluff – your brand and documentation expectations define how your systems will present themselves to investors, regulators, and collaborators.

---

## 9. Interaction Pattern with AI (Including Me)

Your provenance *with respect to AI assistants* looks like this:

- You treat the model as:
  - A long-term collaborator.
  - A node in your “Living System” architecture.
  - A co-architect and sometimes a guardrail.

- You expect:
  - High detail and no hand-wavy nonsense.
  - Realistic constraints acknowledged (laws, hardware limits, bandwidth, money).
  - Multi-step plans in a single deliverable when possible.
  - Clear, honest pushback when your assumptions might be off.

- You use AI to:
  - Architect entire systems (technical, legal, financial, social).
  - Debug highly specific issues (Node versions, firewall configs, encoding).
  - Translate between worlds (your internal symbolic language ⇄ external documentation).

In other words, your provenance here is: *builder of systems who treats AI as part of the system, not a side gadget.*

## 10. High-Level Provenance Summary

If someone asked, “Who is Jayce, based purely on the trace he leaves across these chats?” the concise answer is:

> A neurodivergent, systems-obsessed founder using law, code, AI, real estate, and design as one integrated canvas to build a long-lived, ethically-grounded, self-improving civilization stack—while turning his own trauma, attention hunger, and perfectionism into fuel for durable contributions other people can actually stand on.

That’s the spine of your story across all the planes we’ve been working in so far.
