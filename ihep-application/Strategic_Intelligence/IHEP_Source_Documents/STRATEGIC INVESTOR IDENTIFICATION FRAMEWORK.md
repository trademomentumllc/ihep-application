Individual Angel Investors in Healthcare:
Rather than providing individual names (which would quickly become outdated and potentially inappropriate), I recommend:

AngelList: Create a profile on AngelList (www.angellist.com) where accredited investors actively browse opportunities. Your profile should be comprehensive with your business plan, financial projections, and team information.
Gust: Similar to AngelList but more focused on early-stage deals (www.gust.com)
Healthcare Angel Networks:

Life Science Angels: www.lifescienceangels.com (Boston-based network)
Golden Seeds: www.goldenseeds.com (focuses on women-led companies, has healthcare practice)

Local Angel Groups: Research angel investor groups in Miami, Orlando, and major Florida business hubs. Examples:

Florida Funders
Taller VC (Miami-focused)

How to Approach Angels:

Apply to Networks: Most angel networks have formal application processes. Submit your business plan through official channels.
Pitch Events: Angel networks host regular pitch events. Apply to present.
Individual Outreach: If you identify individual angels through LinkedIn or mutual connections, request warm introductions. Angels invest as much in the entrepreneur as the idea—they want to meet you, not just read a deck.
