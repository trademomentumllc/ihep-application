BUSINESS MODEL AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Revenue Streams
IHEP's business model evolves from grant-supported validation to commercial sustainability:
Phase I-II: Grant and Research Revenue

SBIR/STTR federal funding (non-dilutive)
Foundation grants (HIV/AIDS-focused philanthropy)
Research partnerships with academic institutions
Expected: $4.2M over Years 1-5 (supplements equity financing)

Phase II-III: Early Commercial Revenue

Healthcare system pilot contracts (fee-for-service care coordination)
Research data licensing (de-identified, IRB-approved)
Pharmaceutical partnerships (target identification collaboration)
Expected: $1.2M annually by Year 5

Phase III: Full Commercial Operations

Insurance reimbursement ($150-$300 per member per month for digital therapeutic classification)
EHR integration licensing (enterprise SaaS: $500K-$2M per system annually)
Pharmaceutical partnerships ($2M-$10M per collaboration for cure pathway data access)
International licensing (WHO collaboration, European market entry)
Expected: $35M annually by Year 10

Financial Projections
Based on conservative assumptions (detailed in comprehensive budgetary document):
Year 1:

Participants: 300
Revenue: $0 (full grant coverage)
Operating Expense: $3.45M
Burn Rate: $287K/month

Year 5:

Participants: 5,000
Revenue: $1.2M
Operating Expense: $5.5M
Burn Rate: $358K/month (net of revenue)
Cumulative Investment Required: $27.85M

Year 10:

Participants: 25,000
Revenue: $35M
Operating Expense: $27M
EBITDA Margin: 23%
Cumulative Investment Required: $81.85M (includes significant R&D for cure pathways)

Unit Economics
Patient Acquisition Cost: $500 (combination of community outreach, provider referral, digital marketing)
Lifetime Value (Commercial Phase): $3,600 (assuming $150 PMPM reimbursement, 24-month average engagement)
LTV:CAC Ratio: 7.2:1 (excellent for SaaS business model)
Path to Break-Even
We project operational break-even at approximately 18,000 active participants with full commercial reimbursement, achievable in Year 8. The business becomes cash-flow positive in Year 9, with projected EBITDA margins of 23% by Year 10.
Capital Efficiency
A distinctive feature of our financial model is capital efficiency through federal grant leverage. The SBIR/STTR structure provides:

Phase I: Up to $300K (non-dilutive, competitive application)
Phase II: Up to $2M (non-dilutive, based on Phase I success)
Phase III: Potential for additional federal partnerships

This non-dilutive capital reduces equity financing requirements by an estimated 30-40% compared to pure venture-backed models, enhancing investor returns.
