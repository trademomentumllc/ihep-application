1.2 Employer Email Templates

Template 1: Cold Outreach (First Contact)

Subject: Solve your peer navigator shortage with pre-trained IHEP graduates

Body:

Hi [Hiring Manager Name],

I noticed [Health System Name] recently posted 8 community health worker openings on Indeed. Recruiting for these roles is challenging — I get it. The talent pipeline is thin, and turnover is brutal.

What if you could hire certified peer navigators who are:
- Already trained (80+ hours, CHW certified)
- Deeply motivated (lived experience with chronic conditions)
- Supported for success (12-month retention coaching)
- Zero recruitment cost to you

That's what IHEP does. We're a digital health platform that trains individuals living with HIV/AIDS to become peer navigators and health IT professionals. Our graduates have 80% retention at 12 months (vs. 60% industry average), saving employers $9,000+ per hire in turnover costs.

Next step: 15-minute call to explore if this fits your hiring needs?

SECTION 4: PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TEMPLATES

[See Sections 1.4 and 2.3 above for full templates]

- Background Checks: Some employers require drug tests, criminal background checks—address in Section 3
- Confidentiality: Add specific HIPAA language if employer is covered entity

CDFI Agreements:
- Match Ratios: Default is 2:1 (participant $1 → $2 match), but some CDFIs do 1:1 or 3:1

SECTION 5: SUCCESS STORIES & CASE STUDIES

5.1 Employer Success Story: County Public Health Department

TITLE: How County Public Health Hired 6 IHEP Graduates and Achieved 100% Retention

The Challenge:

County Public Health Department struggled to fill peer navigator roles for their HIV prevention and care coordination programs. Despite posting positions for 6 months, they received few qualified applicants. Those they hired often left within the first year, creating service gaps and forcing the cycle to repeat.

Recruitment Pain Points:
- Only 12 applications for 6 positions over 6 months
- Of those hired, 40% left within 12 months
- Cost per hire: $18,000 (job boards, HR time, relocation assistance)
- Training burden: 3 months to full productivity

The Partnership:

In Q1 2026, County Public Health partnered with IHEP's workforce development program. The agreement:

- 6 positions reserved for IHEP's March 2026 graduating cohort
- Custom training module: IHEP added County-specific content (their EHR system, cultural competency for refugee populations)
- Guaranteed interviews: County committed to interviewing all qualified IHEP candidates

The Results:

Hiring:
- 8 IHEP graduates interviewed (pre-screened by IHEP)
- 6 hired in April 2026 (75% conversion rate)
- All 6 were CHW-certified, HIPAA-trained, and had lived experience with HIV

Retention (as of November 2026):
- 100% retention at 6 months (vs. 60% baseline)
- Peer navigators report high job satisfaction (avg 8.5/10)
- Supervisors rate IHEP hires as "highest performing" navigators

Impact:
- 1,200 clients served by IHEP-trained navigators in 7 months
- 85% viral suppression rate (vs. 72% county avg)
- Zero turnover = $54,000 saved (6 hires Ã— $9K replacement cost)

Quote:

> "IHEP graduates brought something we couldn't teach in training: authentic empathy. They've lived the challenges our clients face—stigma, treatment fatigue, financial barriers. That lived experience builds instant trust. These are our most effective navigators, and they're staying because IHEP provides ongoing support. It's a game-changer for our program."
> — Dr. Maria Gonzalez, HIV Program Director, County Public Health

Partnership Renewal:

County Public Health has committed to reserving 10 positions for IHEP's 2027 cohorts and is exploring hosting IHEP practicum sites.

5.2 CDFI Success Story: Community First Credit Union

TITLE: Community First Credit Union + IHEP: $225,000 in Assets Built for Underserved Community

The Challenge:

Community First Credit Union's mission is financial inclusion, but they struggled to reach deeply underserved populations. Their matched savings program had low enrollment (only 15 participants in 2025), and members often didn't know about wealth-building products.

Partnership Opportunity:

In January 2026, IHEP approached Community First with a partnership proposal: provide matched savings accounts for 75 IHEP participants living with HIV/AIDS. The value proposition:

- Mission alignment: Serve population facing extreme financial exclusion (72% below 200% FPL)
- CRA credit: 100% of participants qualify as LMI
- Lower risk: IHEP provides financial coaching, reducing default risk

The Partnership:

Structure:
- Community First provides IDA accounts (no fees, online banking access)
- 2:1 match: Participant saves $1 → receives $2 match (max $3,000 match per participant)
- IHEP provides financial coaching (bi-weekly sessions), match funding ($150K from grants)

Term: 24 months (Jan 2026 - Dec 2027)

The Results (First 10 Months):

Enrollment:
- 75 participants enrolled (100% of target)
- Demographics: 85% BIPOC, 78% income <$20K/year, 90% in LMI census tracts

Savings Performance:
- Average savings: $750 per participant (10 months)
- Total participant deposits: $56,250
- Match funds deployed: $112,500 (2:1)
- Total assets built: $168,750

Asset Uses (Withdrawals):
- 22 participants made withdrawals:
- Education/training: 10 participants ($28,000) - used for certifications, tuition
- Emergency fund: 8 participants ($16,000) - established 3-month safety nets
- Vehicle down payment: 4 participants ($12,000) - purchased reliable transportation for work

Credit Building:
- Average credit score increase: +27 points (for participants with baseline credit reports)
- 18 participants graduated to unsecured credit cards
- 12 participants qualified for auto loans (previously unqualified)

Quote:

> "This partnership allowed us to reach a community we'd never been able to serve effectively before. IHEP's financial coaching is the secret sauce—participants aren't just saving money, they're building financial capability. We've seen credit scores jump 50+ points, people buying cars to get to work, families establishing emergency funds. This is exactly why we exist as a CDFI."
> — Michael Chen, CEO, Community First Credit Union

Partnership Expansion:

Based on strong results, Community First is expanding the partnership in 2027:
- Emergency loan fund: $100K revolving fund for 3-5% interest loans
- Homeownership prep program: 25 participants in mortgage readiness track
- Target: 150 participants, $500K total assets built

CRA Impact:

Community First reported this partnership in their 2026 CRA assessment:
- Investment Test: $112,500 qualified investment (match funds)
- Service Test: 75 LMI individuals served with financial education + products
- Lending Test (2027): $100K in emergency loans to LMI borrowers
