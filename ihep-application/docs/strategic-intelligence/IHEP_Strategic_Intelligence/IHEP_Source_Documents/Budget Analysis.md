4.2 Revenue Model and Path to Sustainability
The revenue model transitions across phases from grant-dependent to commercially sustainable:
Phase I Revenue (Validation Stage)

Primary: SBIR/STTR Phase I grants
Secondary: Foundation grants (HIV/AIDS-focused philanthropy)
Tertiary: Academic partnerships with minimal cost recovery
Expected Revenue: Zero (full grant coverage required)

Phase II Revenue (Early Commercialization)

Primary: SBIR/STTR Phase II grants
Secondary: Pilot contracts with healthcare systems (cost recovery plus 15% margin)
Tertiary: Research data licensing (de-identified, IRB-approved)
Expected Revenue: 1.2M annually by Year 5 (covers approximately 15% of operational costs)

Phase III Revenue (Commercial Sustainability)

Primary: Insurance reimbursement for digital therapeutic services ($150-$300 per member per month)
Secondary: EHR integration licensing (enterprise contracts $500K-$2M annually)
Tertiary: Pharmaceutical partnership for cure pathway data access ($2M-$10M per partnership)
Quaternary: International licensing and WHO collaborations
Expected Revenue: 35M annually by Year 10 (achieves operational sustainability with 25% margin)

Revenue Growth Model
R(t)=R0⋅(1+g)t+∑i=1nCi(t)R(t) = R_0 \cdot (1 + g)^t + \sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i(t)R(t)=R0​⋅(1+g)t+i=1∑n​Ci​(t)
Where:

R0R_0
R0​ = Base recurring revenue

gg
g = Annual growth rate (projected 45% for healthcare SaaS)

Ci(t)C_i(t)
Ci​(t) = New contract values added at time tt
