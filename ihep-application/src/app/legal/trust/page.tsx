      <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-md p-6 my-6">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3 text-xl">Our Commitment to You</h3>
        <p className="text-base">
          The Integrated Health Empowerment Program (IHEP) is built on a foundation of trust, transparency,
          and unwavering commitment to your health, privacy, and empowerment. This Trust Statement articulates
          the principles that guide every decision we make and the values that define our relationship with you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Core Trust Principles</h2>

      <h3>1.1 You Own Your Data</h3>
      <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-md p-4 my-4">
        <p className="font-bold text-green-900">
          Your health data belongs to you, period.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2">
          IHEP is the steward of your information, never the owner. You have complete control over what
          data you share, who can access it, how it's used, and when to export or delete it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2 font-bold">
          We will never sell your personal health information to third parties. Your data is not a commodity—it
          is a sacred trust.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>1.2 Transparency in All Things</h3>
      <p>We believe you deserve to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exactly what data we collect and why</li>
        <li>How AI systems make recommendations that affect your care</li>
        <li>Who has access to your information and under what circumstances</li>
        <li>How we make money and sustain our operations</li>
        <li>When things go wrong and what we're doing to fix them</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="font-semibold mt-2">
        Hidden agendas and obscure practices have no place in healthcare. We commit to plain-language
        explanations and open communication.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Privacy as a Human Right</h3>
      <p>Your privacy is not negotiable. We implement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Military-grade encryption for all data in transit and at rest</li>
        <li>Strict access controls limited to authorized personnel only</li>
        <li>Regular third-party security audits</li>
        <li>Immediate breach notification if incidents occur</li>
        <li>HIPAA-compliant practices that exceed minimum standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="font-semibold mt-2">
        Privacy is embedded in our architecture, not added as an afterthought.
      </p>

      <h3>1.4 Human-Centered AI</h3>
      <div className="bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 rounded-md p-4 my-4">
        <p className="font-bold text-purple-900">
          Artificial Intelligence enhances care—it does not replace human judgment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2">We guarantee:</p>
        <ul className="text-sm mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>• AI systems provide decision support only; licensed professionals make final clinical decisions</li>
          <li>• You can always request a human review of AI recommendations</li>
          <li>• AI models are tested rigorously for fairness across all populations</li>
          <li>• You receive explanations of how AI systems reach conclusions</li>
          <li>• You can opt-out of AI-driven features when clinically appropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2 font-bold">
          Technology serves humanity, not the other way around.
