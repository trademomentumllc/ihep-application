HealthOutcome(t) = f(ClinicalFactors, FinancialStability(t), SocialSupport(t))

Where:
FinancialStability(t) = Income(t) - Expenses(t) + Benefits(t) + Savings(t)

Feedback loop:
Income(t+1) = Income(t) + δ(HealthOutcome(t)) × EmploymentCapacity

Where δ represents the derivative of income improvement based on health status
