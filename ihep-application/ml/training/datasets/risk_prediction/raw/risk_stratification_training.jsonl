Real confidentiality concerns with insurance\n\n**This is a psychosocially complex situation requiring patience, trust-building, and creative problem-solving.**\n\n**Why He Declined ART:**\n\nPatients rarely decline treatment because they don't want to be healthy. Common reasons in this profile:\n- Denial/not ready to accept diagnosis\n- Fear that taking pills makes it \"real\"\n- Logistics of hiding medication from parents\n- Not understanding why treatment matters when feeling fine\n- Overwhelmed by the diagnosis itself\n- Concerns about side effects\n- Doesn't trust healthcare system yet\n\n**Understanding the Missed Follow-Up:**\n\n- He DID come to the first appointment - he's not fully disengaged\n- Missing follow-up may reflect ambivalence, not rejection\n- May be scared, overwhelmed, or struggling with next steps\n- Could be avoiding pressure to start medication\n\n**The Disclosure Dilemma:**\n\nHe's carrying three secrets:\n1. Sexual orientation (MSM)\n2. HIV diagnosis\n3. Potentially relationship/sexual history\n\nThis is an enormous psychological burden for a 19-year-old. His reluctance to engage may be partly about protecting these secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Approach\n\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLES:**\n\n1. **Build Trust Before Pushing Treatment**\n   - He won't engage with someone who feels like pressure\n   - Meet him where he is, not where we want him to be\n   - Treatment will happen when he's ready\n\n2. **Address Real Barriers, Not Just Behavior**\n   - His barriers are structural and psychosocial\n   - Solving confidentiality issues may unlock everything else\n\n3. **Normalize His Experience**\n   - Many young people feel this way after diagnosis\n   - He's not \"non-compliant\" - he's struggling\n\n**IMMEDIATE OUTREACH (Within 1 Week):**\n\n1. **Non-Pressuring Contact**\n   - Text preferred (phone calls may be overheard)\n   - \"Just checking in, no pressure. We're here when you're ready.\"\n   - Offer to answer any questions\n   - Don't lead with treatment push\n\n2. **Peer Navigation**\n   - Connect with a young person living with HIV (peer navigator)\n   - Someone who understands his experience\n   - Often more trusted than clinical staff initially\n   - Can share their own journey\n\n**WHEN HE RE-ENGAGES:**\n\n3. **Address Confidentiality Concerns First**\n\n*Insurance Issues:*\n- Explore Ryan White/ADAP for medications (bypasses parent insurance)\n- Confidential Title X services if available\n- Some states have minor consent laws for STI/HIV treatment\n- Clinic may have confidential billing options\n\n*Medication Logistics:*\n- Where could he safely store medication?\n- Could medication be kept at clinic for pick-up?\n- Could he keep it at his friend's house?\n- Single-tablet regimens are discreet (small pill, once daily)\n\n4. **Supportive Exploration of Diagnosis**\n   - How is he coping? (Even if he refused PHQ-9)\n   - What does having HIV mean to him?\n   - What has he read/heard?\n   - Address myths and fears\n\n5. **Sexual Orientation Support**\n   - If he's processing being MSM, that's a separate need\n   - LGBTQ+ affirming counseling\n   - Community connections\n   - This may be the underlying issue preventing engagement\n\n**TREATMENT READINESS:**\n\n6. **When Discussing Treatment (Not Before He's Ready):**\n   - Frame as his choice, his timeline\n   - Explain benefits without pressure\n   - U=U may be motivating (can't transmit to partners when undetectable)\n   - Address specific concerns he raises\n   - One tablet, once daily options are simple\n\n7. **Harm Reduction for Now:**\n   - If he's not ready for treatment, at least:\n   - Condom use education\n   - Partner notification awareness\n   - Symptoms to watch for\n   - When to seek urgent care\n   - Keep the door open\n\n**LONGER TERM:**\n\n8. **Support System Building**\n   - Support groups for young MSM with HIV\n   - LGBTQ+ community centers\n   - Online communities (can be anonymous)\n   - Prepare for potential family disclosure (when HE's ready)\n\n9. **Mental Health**\n   - Revisit screening when trust is established\n   - Trauma-informed, LGBTQ+-affirming therapist\n   - Address multiple intersecting stressors\n\n---\n\n### Risk Trajectory\n\n**Without Engagement:**\n\n| Outcome | 3-Month | 6-Month | 12-Month |\n|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Complete disengagement | 50% | 65% | 75% |\n| No ART initiation | 70% | 60% | 50% |\n| Mental health crisis | 30% | 45% | 55% |\n| Potential transmission | Elevated | Elevated | Elevated |\n| Disease progression | Moderate | Moderate | Significant |\n\n**With Patient-Centered, Trust-Building Approach:**\n\n| Outcome | 3-Month | 6-Month | 12-Month |\n|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Engagement in care | 50% | 70% | 85% |\n| ART initiation | 40% | 65% | 80% |\n| Peer support connected | 60% | 75% | 85% |\n| Mental health addressed | 45% | 60% | 75% |\n| Viral suppression | 30% | 55% | 70% |\n\n---\n\n### Special Considerations\n\n**CD4 of 310:**\n- Not in immediate danger zone (>200 = not AIDS)\n- But treatment delay does carry risks\n- We have time to build relationship, but not unlimited time\n- If he develops symptoms, changes urgency\n\n**Mandatory Reporting:**\n- Check state laws regarding minor consent, partner notification\n- Ensure confidentiality to extent legally possible\n- Explain any limitations to him\n\n**Family Dynamics:**\n- Don't assume parents would react negatively\n- But also respect his assessment of his own situation\n- Some parents are supportive when disclosure happens\n- His safety and housing security matter\n\n---\n\n### Model Confidence: 72%\n\n**Explanation:** Moderate-high confidence in risk assessment, but uncertainty about underlying factors given limited engagement (refused screening, missed follow-up). Risk could be higher or lower depending on factors not yet known.\n\n**Recommended for:** Youth-specialized team, peer navigation, LGBTQ+-affirming care team\n\n**Key Success Metric:** Re-engagement, not immediate treatment.

Processing a new HIV diagnosis\n2. Potentially still processing sexual orientation\n3. Living in a household where neither is known\n4. Lacking adult support systems\n5. Real confidentiality concerns with insurance\n\n**This is a psychosocially complex situation requiring patience, trust-building, and creative problem-solving.**\n\n**Why She Declined ART:**\n\nPatients rarely decline treatment because they don't want to be healthy. Common reasons in this profile:\n- Denial/not ready to accept diagnosis\n- Fear that taking pills makes it \"real\"\n- Logistics of hiding medication from parents\n- Not understanding why treatment matters when feeling fine\n- Overwhelmed by the diagnosis itself\n- Concerns about side effects\n- Doesn't trust healthcare system yet\n\n**Understanding the Missed Follow-Up:**\n\n- She DID come to the first appointment - she's not fully disengaged\n- Missing follow-up may reflect ambivalence, not rejection\n- May be scared, overwhelmed, or struggling with next steps\n- Could be avoiding pressure to start medication\n\n**The Disclosure Dilemma:**\n\nShe's carrying three secrets:\n1.

Monitor for problems?\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Actions\n\n**WHILE IN SNF (Current):**\n\n1. **Medication Reconciliation**\n   - Verify Biktarvy is being given correctly at SNF\n   - Check for any drug interactions with new medications (pain, bone health)\n   - Ensure no disruption in HIV medication\n\n2. **Cognitive Follow-Up**\n   - Repeat cognitive screening before discharge (MoCA or MMSE)\n   - If improved: May have been hospital delirium\n   - If stable/worse: Needs outpatient cognitive evaluation\n\n3. **Discharge Planning (Start Now)**\n   - Social work assessment of home safety\n   - Can she manage independently with current cognition?\n   - What supports are needed?\n\n**TRANSITION TO HOME:**\n\n4. **Home Assessment**\n   - Fall prevention evaluation (fracture + osteopenia = high re-fracture risk)\n   - Medication management assessment\n   - Functional capacity for ADLs\n\n5. **Support Services**\n\n*If Mild Impairment Only:*\n- Pill organizer (visual confirmation)\n- Phone reminders with confirmation\n- Weekly check-in calls from clinic\n- Consider pharmacy delivery\n- Home health aide for short-term transition\n\n*If More Significant Impairment:*\n- Daily home health visits\n- Medication management by home health\n- Consider higher level of care (assisted living)\n- Identify emergency contacts (friends, distant family)\n\n6. **HIV Care Coordination**\n   - Schedule HIV clinic visit within 2 weeks of discharge\n   - Communicate with her HIV provider about hospitalization\n   - Ensure HIV care team knows about cognitive findings\n   - Telehealth visit if transportation is barrier\n\n**MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP:**\n\n7. **Bone Health (Given Fracture + Osteopenia)**\n   - DEXA scan when ambulatory\n   - Consider bisphosphonate therapy\n   - Vitamin D + calcium supplementation\n   - Fall prevention program\n\n8. **Cognitive Evaluation**\n   - If MoCA doesn't improve: Formal neuropsychological testing\n   - Brain MRI to evaluate for structural causes\n   - HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder evaluation\n   - Address if treatable factors (B12, thyroid, depression contributing)\n\n9. **Depression Monitoring**\n   - PHQ-9 of 6 is mild, but she's facing:\n   - Major injury and surgery\n   - Loss of independence (even temporary)\n   - Possible cognitive decline\n   - Isolation\n   - Recheck in 4-6 weeks\n\n**LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n10. **Aging with HIV Planning**\n    - This is a good time to discuss advance directives\n    - Emergency contact identification\n    - Healthcare proxy designation\n    - Long-term living situation if needs increase\n\n11. **If Cognitive Decline Confirmed:**\n    - Simplify regimen further if possible (already on STR - good)\n    - Long-acting injectable consideration (bimonthly vs daily)\n    - Increased oversight structure\n    - Periodic reassessment of independence capacity\n\n---\n\n### Transition Checklist\n\n**Before SNF Discharge:**\n- [ ] Medications reconciled and correct\n- [ ] HIV provider notified of hospitalization\n- [ ] Cognitive status reassessed\n- [ ] Home safety evaluation completed\n- [ ] Support services arranged\n- [ ] Follow-up appointments scheduled\n- [ ] Transportation arranged\n- [ ] Emergency contacts identified\n- [ ] Pharmacy delivery set up if needed\n\n**First Week Home:**\n- [ ] Home health visit (if arranged)\n- [ ] Medication adherence confirmed\n- [ ] Check-in call from care team\n- [ ] No signs of decompensation\n\n**30-Day Follow-Up:**\n- [ ] HIV clinic visit completed\n- [ ] Labs updated (VL, CD4, metabolic)\n- [ ] Cognitive retest completed\n- [ ] Bone health follow-up\n- [ ] Functional assessment\n\n---\n\n### Predicted Outcomes\n\n**Without Coordinated Transition:**\n\n| Outcome | 30-Day Risk | 90-Day Risk |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Medication disruption | 35% | 20% |\n| Missed follow-up | 25% | 15% |\n| Rehospitalization | 30% | 20% |\n| Functional decline | 40% | 50% |\n| Viral rebound (if adherence fails) | 5% | 15% |\n\n**With Coordinated Transition:**\n\n| Outcome | 30-Day Risk | 90-Day Risk |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Medication disruption | 5% | 3% |\n| Missed follow-up | 5% | 5% |\n| Rehospitalization | 15% | 10% |\n| Functional recovery | 70% | 80% |\n| Maintained viral suppression | 99% | 98% |\n\n---\n\n### Risk Level Summary\n\n**Current Risk:** MODERATE-HIGH (0.55) due to transition period\n\n**Expected Risk After Successful Transition:** LOW (0.15) - returns to baseline excellent status\n\n**Key Point:** This is a transitional risk period for someone who is otherwise very stable.

Even healthcare workers do.\"\n- \"There's no judgment here - we just want to figure out how to help.\"\n\n**Specific patterns:**\n- \"Do weekends ever look different from weekdays?\"\n- \"What happens when you travel or your routine changes?\"\n- \"Have there been any stressful times recently that affected your routine?\"\n\n**Opening doors:**\n- \"Sometimes people pick up their medications but life gets in the way of taking them consistently.\"\n- \"The pills can be hard to take - side effects, or just the reminder of living with HIV.\"\n\n**Direct but supportive:**\n- \"Your labs don't match what we'd expect if the medication was being taken regularly. I'm not trying to catch you in anything - I'm trying to figure out how to help. What do you think might be going on?\"\n\n**ADDRESSING DENIAL:**\n\n5. **If Patient Continues to Deny:**\n   - Don't argue - accept her report\n   - Use drug levels as objective data\n   - \"Let's check a drug level to make sure the medication is working in your body the way it should\"\n   - Results may open conversation\n\n6. **Consider Hidden Barriers:**\n   - Depression (PHQ-9 is 6, but may be under-reporting)\n   - Substance use (not mentioned but worth exploring)\n   - HIV fatigue (18 years on treatment is long)\n   - Diversion (financial desperation)\n   - Partner doesn't know status (hiding pill-taking)\n\n---\n\n### Clinical Decision Points\n\n**Based on Resistance Testing Results:**\n\n*If Wild-Type (No Resistance):*\n→ Confirms adherence issue\n→ Intensive adherence intervention\n→ Consider long-acting injectable when eligible (must be suppressed first)\n→ Address underlying barriers\n→ More frequent monitoring\n\n*If Resistance Detected:*\n→ Change regimen based on genotype\n→ Still address adherence (resistance developed due to non-adherence)\n→ Adherence support even more critical for new regimen\n→ Determine if resistance affects future options significantly\n\n**CD4 <200 Implications:**\n\n- She has met AIDS criteria by CD4 count\n- Needs opportunistic infection prophylaxis:\n  - TMP-SMX for PCP/toxoplasmosis prevention\n  - Assess for MAC prophylaxis if CD4 drops further\n- Higher risk for opportunistic infections\n- Screen for active OI (symptoms?)\n\n---\n\n### Adherence Interventions\n\n**If She Acknowledges Difficulty:**\n\n1. **Simplification**\n   - Already on STR (single tablet), but consider:\n   - Does timing work for her life?\n   - Morning vs evening?\n   - With food vs without?\n\n2. **Practical Tools**\n   - Pill organizer\n   - Phone alarms\n   - Link to existing habit\n   - Partner involvement (if disclosed)\n\n3. **Long-Acting Injectable Candidacy**\n   - Cabenuva is an option\n   - BUT: Must be suppressed first (VL<200, ideally undetectable)\n   - So: Suppress with intensive support, then switch to LAI\n   - This removes daily adherence burden entirely\n\n4. **DOT/Observed Therapy (Short-Term)**\n   - If critical situation\n   - Can be done at clinic or by home health\n   - Builds habit, confirms medication works\n   - Not sustainable long-term but can break cycle\n\n---\n\n### Predicted Outcomes\n\n**Without Intervention:**\n\n| Outcome | 6-Month | 12-Month |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Continued viremia | 95% | 95% |\n| Further CD4 decline | 80% | 90% |\n| Opportunistic infection | 20% | 40% |\n| AIDS-defining illness | 15% | 30% |\n| Resistance development | 40% | 60% |\n| Hospitalization | 25% | 45% |\n\n**With Intensive Intervention (Assuming Adherence Issue):**\n\n| Outcome | 6-Month | 12-Month |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Viral suppression achieved | 60% | 70% |\n| CD4 recovery begins | 50% | 65% |\n| Opportunistic infection prevented | 90% | 85% |\n| Eligible for LAI | 50% | 65% |\n| Sustained engagement | 80% | 75% |\n\n---\n\n### Urgency Assessment\n\n**This Is Urgent:**\n\n- CD4 of 180 = AIDS-defining immunosuppression\n- Declining trajectory (was 340 one year ago)\n- At risk for opportunistic infections\n- Each month of viremia increases resistance risk\n- Progressive immunologic damage is occurring\n\n**But Approach Matters:**\n\n- Confrontation won't work (has been tried)\n- Shame won't work\n- Must find what's really going on\n- Patient is engaged (comes to appointments) - work with that\n- She wants to be healthy (continues to refill) - leverage that motivation\n\n---\n\n### Model Confidence: 75%\n\n**Explanation:** Moderate-high confidence in high risk given objective data (viremia, CD4 decline). Uncertainty about underlying cause (adherence vs. resistance vs. other) pending further testing. Strong suspicion of adherence issue based on clinical pattern.\n\n**Recommended for:** Intensive care team discussion, possible multidisciplinary approach (pharmacist for drug levels, adherence counselor, provider). Consider HIV specialist consultation if not already specialty care.\n\n**Key Next Step:** Resistance testing and drug level to clarify picture before determining path forward.", "metadata": {"category": "risk_prediction", "risk_type": "treatment_failure", "risk_level": "high", "patient_population": "long_term_patient", "special_considerations": "suspected_nonadherence", "source": "synthetic_balanced", "gender_balanced": true}}
