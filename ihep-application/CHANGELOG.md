- Removed dynamic JWT client secret generation at runtime
- Applications must configure Apple client secret in environment

**Build Process:**
- OAuth credentials can now use dummy values during build
- Runtime still requires actual OAuth credentials for functionality
- CI/CD environments no longer require OAuth secrets for builds

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Added vitest as test runner (was not configured before)
- Test files now require vitest imports
- New test scripts available: `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`

### ⚡ Migration Guide

**For Developers:**

   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_apple_client_secret_here
   ```

2. **Install New Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. **Run Tests:**

   npm run build
   ```

**For Production Deployments:**

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure `APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is configured in production
   - Update all OAuth provider credentials
   - Set `SESSION_SECRET` for NextAuth

2. **Security Audit:**
   ```bash
   npm audit --production
   # Should report: 0 vulnerabilities
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   - All CI checks must pass
