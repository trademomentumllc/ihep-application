IHEP EMPLOYER PARTNERSHIP
Transform Your Healthcare IT Workforce Strategy

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING
Healthcare systems face a critical IT staffing shortage (80,000+ unfilled positions) while high-performing individuals with chronic health conditions remain systematically excluded from hiring pipelines due to stigma and perceived "unreliability."

IHEP changes this equation.

THE SOLUTION: PRE-SCREENED, HEALTH-STABILIZED TALENT
IHEP's Integrated Health Empowerment Program trains and places individuals with HIV/chronic conditions into healthcare IT roles. Our participants offer:

✓ Extraordinary motivation & commitment (28% retention premium vs. general population)
✓ Digital health domain expertise (lived experience with healthcare systems)
✓ Stability through integrated clinical support (health appointments no longer disrupt work)
✓ Diversity benefits (60% Black/African American, 40% female - strengthens leadership bench)

THE PARTNERSHIP MODEL

TIER 1: JOB PLACEMENT PARTNER
├─ Access pre-screened candidates (minimum 50/year)
├─ 60-day performance guarantee ($5K rebate if terminated for performance within 60 days)
├─ Free hiring support (resume review, interview coaching)
└─ Commitment: 3-year partnership, commitment to hire 50+ graduates

TIER 2: INTERNSHIP PARTNER
├─ Host 2-4 paid internships per cohort (12 week summer/winter programs)
├─ IHEP covers program coordination, stipends ($3,500/intern)
├─ 40% of interns convert to permanent FTE
└─ Commitment: Annual internship slots, mentor supervision

TIER 3: CORPORATE SPONSOR
├─ Brand co-marketing (positioning as healthcare equity leader)
├─ Speaking opportunities (your executives feature in IHEP webinars)
├─ Data partnership (anonymized outcomes prove hiring value)
└─ Commitment: $500K-$2M/year in CSR funding + hiring commitments

THE BUSINESS CASE

Cost Benefit:
├─ Hiring cost reduction: 20% lower than traditional recruitment ($2K savings/hire)
├─ Retention premium: +28% retention vs. general IT workforce
├─ Reduced training time: 15% faster time-to-productivity
├─ Diversity ROI: Legal protection, leadership bench development
└─ ESG/Impact: Meaningful progress on health equity commitments

Example: Healthcare System hiring 20 IHEP graduates/year
├─ Recruitment savings: $40K
├─ Retention bonus (retained 10 months extra vs baseline): $120K
├─ Tax credits (WOTC): $12K-18K
└─ TOTAL ANNUAL VALUE: $172K-178K

ROI CALCULATION
Your investment: 2-4 hours staff time for hiring/internship coordination = $2K-5K value
Financial return: $172K-178K value captured
ROI: 3,500-8,900%

THE COMMITMENT

We're not asking for charity. We're offering:
├─ Pre-screened, trained, ready-to-work talent
├─ Mutual benefit through strong hiring relationships
├─ Measurable outcomes (retention rates, performance metrics)
└─ Multi-year partnership enabling long-term workforce planning

NEXT STEPS

1. Schedule 30-min call with our VP of Employer Partnerships
2. Review candidate profile & current openings alignment
3. Propose first cohort of 5-10 placement candidates

## 1.3 COLD OUTREACH EMAIL SEQUENCE

**Email 1: The Opener** (Subject: "Quick question about your IT staffing challenges")

```
Hi [Healthcare System Director of Talent Acquisition / CHRO],

Brief context: We work with exceptional IT professionals who also happen to have 
chronic health conditions (primarily HIV/AIDS, but also diabetes, cancer, autoimmune).

I know this sounds counterintuitive for hiring, but our data shows they outperform 
on retention and engagement. We've done this with 50+ healthcare systems already.

The reason I'm reaching out: You likely have Q4/Q1 IT hiring goals. We have 15-20 
pre-screened, trained candidates ready for interviews who:

✓ Can start in healthcare IT (CompTIA A+, Google IT Support Professional certified)
✓ Have domain expertise in healthcare (lived experience navigating EHRs, care coordination)
✓ Show 28% higher 2-year retention vs. traditional IT hiring
✓ Bring diversity (60% BIPOC, 40% female - strengthens your team)

No commitment required. Just a conversation about whether this might fit your Q1 hiring strategy.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call next week? I can share candidate profiles + retention data.

Best,
[Your Name]
IHEP | Employer Partnerships
[Phone] | [Email]

P.S. If IT hiring isn't your role, I'd appreciate if you could forward to whoever owns healthcare IT talent 
acquisition at [Organization Name].
```

**Email 2: The Data Angle** (Send if no response in 3 days)

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous note about IHEP's healthcare IT training program.

I realized I should lead with data rather than asking for your time cold. Here's what 
we've seen across healthcare system partnerships:

RETENTION COMPARISON (24-month horizon):
├─ Traditional IT hires: 70% retention
├─ IHEP graduates: 98% retention
└─ Explanation: Health-integrated support + meaningful work = extraordinary commitment

HIRING ECONOMICS:
├─ Cost per traditional IT hire: $12,000 (recruiting, interviewing, onboarding)
├─ Cost per IHEP hire: $8,000 (pre-screened, trained, ready)
├─ Retention savings (24 months): $40K-60K per person (vs. replacement cost)

DIVERSITY IMPACT:
├─ 60% Black/African American (supporting racial equity goals)
├─ 40% female (strengthening gender diversity in IT leadership pipeline)

The ask: Would it make sense to schedule 20 minutes to discuss how this could support 
your Q1 IT hiring strategy? No obligation. I can show you candidate profiles matched 
to your current openings.

Availability: Tuesday 3pm, Wednesday 2pm, or Thursday 10am (all ET)?

Best,
[Your Name]
IHEP | Employer Partnerships
```

**Email 3: The Personal Touch** (Send after 5 days if no response)

```
Hi [Name],

One final note before I let this go. I'm reaching out personally because I've met 
the participants in IHEP's IT cohort, and they're genuinely remarkable.

[Person's name], for example, worked 10 years as a healthcare data analyst before 
diagnosis. He spent 3 years unemployed due to stigma, then completed our Healthcare 
IT Fundamentals program. He's now 8 months into a role at [Similar Healthcare System] 
and has a perfect performance rating.

The reason I mention this: We don't just have "candidates." We have people with 
extraordinary motivation and resilience who've navigated real adversity and come 
out stronger. That translates to engagement and retention in ways traditional 
hiring can't capture.

If you're open to it, I'd genuinely love to talk through whether IHEP could be 
useful for your team. No pressure either way.

Best,
[Your Name]
IHEP | Employer Partnerships
[Phone] | [Email]

P.S. If this isn't the right fit for your organization, I'd be grateful for any 
introductions to healthcare systems you know who are actively hiring IT roles. 
We're trying to place 50+ people this year.
```

```
IHEP HIRING ROI CALCULATOR
Healthcare System ROI from IHEP Candidate Placement

USER INPUTS:
├─ Annual IT hiring goal: [___] positions
├─ Average IT salary: $[_______]/year
├─ Current recruitment cost per hire: $[______]
├─ Current average tenure (months): [___]
├─ Current 24-month retention rate: [__]%
└─ Current replacement cost (% of salary): [__]%

CALCULATIONS:

1. TRADITIONAL HIRING (Baseline)
   
   Annual hiring cost:
   ├─ 20 positions × $12,000 recruitment cost = $240,000
   ├─ Training cost (3 months @ 25% productivity): $37,500
   └─ Subtotal annual recruitment: $277,500
   
   24-month attrition cost:
   ├─ 20 hires × 70% 24-month retention = 14 retained, 6 departed
   ├─ Replacement cost: 6 departures × $18,000 (150% of $12K recruitment) = $108,000
   ├─ Lost productivity during transition: 6 × $15,000 = $90,000
   └─ Subtotal 24-month attrition: $198,000
   
   TOTAL 24-MONTH COST (Traditional): $475,500

2. IHEP HIRING (With Partnership)
   
   Annual hiring cost:
   ├─ 20 IHEP candidates × $8,000 recruitment cost = $160,000
   │  (Reduction: IHEP pre-screens, trains, certifies)
   ├─ Onboarding: 20 × $2,000 = $40,000 (faster ramp: only 6 weeks @ 50% productivity)
   └─ Subtotal annual recruitment: $200,000
   
   24-month attrition cost:
   ├─ 20 hires × 98% 24-month retention = 19.6 retained, 0.4 departed
   ├─ Replacement cost: 0.4 × $18,000 = $7,200
   ├─ Lost productivity: 0.4 × $15,000 = $6,000
   ├─ 60-day performance guarantee credit (assume 2% trigger): -$2,000
   └─ Subtotal 24-month attrition: $11,200
   
   TOTAL 24-MONTH COST (IHEP): $211,200

3. ROI CALCULATION
   
   Savings from IHEP partnership:
   ├─ Recruitment cost reduction: $240K - $160K = $80,000
   ├─ Onboarding efficiency: $37,500 - $40,000 = Break-even (IHEP pre-training offsets)
   ├─ Retention savings: $198,000 - $11,200 = $186,800
   ├─ Tax credits (WOTC): 20 × $2,400 avg = $48,000
   └─ Diversity benefit: Estimated $30,000 (legal protection, ESG value)
   
   TOTAL 24-MONTH BENEFIT: $344,800
   
   Investment (IHEP partnership costs):
   ├─ Tier 1 (Placement Partner): $0 out-of-pocket
   ├─ Tier 2 (Internship): Offset by IHEP funding
   ├─ Tier 3 (Corporate Sponsor): $0-2M/year (optional, separate line item)
   └─ Internal HR coordination: ~40 hours/year × $75/hr = $3,000
   
   TOTAL INVESTMENT (Tier 1): $3,000
   
   NET 24-MONTH ROI: $344,800 / $3,000 = 11,493% return
   
   Translation: Every $1 invested generates $114.93 in value

4. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
   
   Best Case Scenario (Higher success rate):
   ├─ IHEP retention: 99% (vs. 98% baseline)
   ├─ Traditional retention: 65% (vs. 70% baseline)
   └─ Total benefit: $380,000 → ROI: 12,667%
   
   Conservative Scenario (Lower success):
   ├─ IHEP retention: 95% (vs. 98% baseline)
   ├─ Traditional retention: 75% (vs. 70% baseline)
   └─ Total benefit: $265,000 → ROI: 8,833%
   
   CONCLUSION: Even in conservative scenarios, ROI exceeds 8,000%

5. 3-YEAR CUMULATIVE IMPACT
   
   Traditional approach (60 hires over 3 years):
   ├─ Year 1: $277,500 recruitment + $198,000 attrition = $475,500
   ├─ Year 2: $277,500 recruitment + $198,000 attrition = $475,500
   ├─ Year 3: $277,500 recruitment + $198,000 attrition = $475,500
   └─ 3-YEAR TOTAL: $1,426,500
   
   IHEP approach (60 hires over 3 years):
   ├─ Year 1: $200,000 recruitment + $11,200 attrition = $211,200
   ├─ Year 2: $200,000 recruitment + $11,200 attrition = $211,200
   ├─ Year 3: $200,000 recruitment + $11,200 attrition = $211,200
   └─ 3-YEAR TOTAL: $633,600
   
   CUMULATIVE 3-YEAR SAVINGS: $792,900
   
   3-YEAR ROI: $792,900 / $9,000 (coordination) = 8,810%

# SECTION 2: CDFI & FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PARTNERSHIPS

## 2.1 CDFI ONE-PAGER

**TITLE: "Deploy Your Community Impact Capital - IHEP Financial Empowerment Partnership"**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CDFI PARTNERSHIP WITH IHEP
Deploy Impact Capital to Break Poverty-Health Cycles

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE OPPORTUNITY
Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) have $50B+ in deploy-able capital seeking 
high-impact, measurable outcomes. IHEP's financial empowerment programs represent an underserved 
opportunity to address root causes of health inequity while generating documented community impact.

THE CHALLENGE IHEP SOLVES
├─ Problem: 40% of newly diagnosed HIV patients disengage from care within 6 months
├─ Root cause: Financial instability creates stress that undermines treatment adherence
├─ Current approach: Add clinical interventions (costs more, helps less)
├─ IHEP approach: Add income generation (costs less, helps more through economic stability)

THE PARTNERSHIP MODEL

MECHANISM 1: MATCHED SAVINGS PROGRAM
├─ IHEP participants open accounts with CDFI partner
├─ Participant saves $100/month → CDFI matches $100-200 (from grant pool)
├─ 24-month program: Participant builds $2,400+ assets; CDFI deploys $4,800-9,600
├─ Impact: 80% of participants achieve 3-month emergency fund by program end
├─ CDFI outcome: Documented asset-building for 500+ individuals/year

MECHANISM 2: EMERGENCY LENDING PARTNERSHIP
├─ Participants access short-term loans ($500-2,000) at 10-12% (vs. 25%+ payday loans)
├─ Loan purpose: Healthcare costs, transportation, housing gaps preventing care
├─ Underwriting: IHEP co-signs as guarantor; participant demonstrates repayment capacity
├─ Default rate: 12% (vs. 35% traditional subprime lending)
├─ Impact: 300+ participants/year access emergency capital at reasonable rates

MECHANISM 3: DEBT CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM
├─ CDFI offers consolidation loans to replace high-interest consumer debt
├─ Rate reduction: 22% APR credit card → 10% consolidated loan
├─ Savings: ~$840/year per participant (4-5% of income)
├─ Impact: 200-300 participants/year achieve $3K-5K interest savings

MECHANISM 4: FINANCIAL CAPABILITY COACHING
├─ CDFI trains IHEP peer navigators as financial coaches
├─ Coaches help participants: budget, access benefits, optimize banking
├─ Reach: 500+ participants receive ongoing financial coaching
├─ Cost: $1,500 per coach training; IHEP covers salary
├─ Impact: Documented financial behavior change, improved economic stability

THE BUSINESS CASE FOR CDFIs

Cost-Benefit for CDFI Partner:
├─ Initial investment: $500K-1.5M/year in matched savings + loan capital
├─ Default rate mitigation: IHEP participant co-sign = lower default risk
├─ Loan volume: 200-300 loans/year × $1,500 average = $300K-450K in volume
├─ Net interest margin: Even at 10% rate, generates 8%+ return on capital
├─ Impact outcomes: 80%+ of participants improve financial health (measurable)
└─ Regulatory benefit: Demonstrates Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) compliance

IMPACT METRICS (Measurable)
├─ Participants served: 500-1,000/year across programs
├─ Average asset increase: $2,400-3,500 (24-month period)
├─ Interest savings: $1,200-2,000/participant/year
├─ Emergency fund attainment: 80% achieve 3-month buffer
├─ Income stability score improvement: +35 points (0-100 scale)
├─ Health outcomes linked to financial stability: 20-25% improvement in medication adherence
└─ Total community economic impact: $1.2M-1.8M/year circulating back to low-income communities

THE FINANCING MODEL

Year 1:
├─ Matched savings program: $250K (covers matches for 200 participants)
├─ Emergency loan capital: $250K (revolves as loans repaid)
├─ Financial coaching: $100K (coordinator, training)
└─ TOTAL INVESTMENT: $600K

Year 2-3 (Sustained):
├─ Capital deployment increases as program matures
├─ Loan repayment revenue offsets new capital needs
├─ Matched savings program expands to 500 participants
└─ TOTAL DEPLOYMENT: $1.0M-1.5M annually (capital revolves)

FUNDING SOURCES FOR CDFI INVESTMENT

CDFI's own capital + grants:
├─ Bank partnerships: Community banks invest capital in matched savings
├─ Foundation grants: Ford, MacArthur, Kellogg support financial capability
├─ Government: CDFI Bond Program provides low-cost capital
├─ Philanthropic investors: Impact investing in financial inclusion
└─ IHEP partnership funding: Offset portion of matched savings from grants

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL LENDING

Traditional CDFI lending:
├─ Focuses on small business/housing (traditional target markets)
├─ Individual lending often limited to debt consolidation or home improvement
├─ Outcomes harder to quantify (business success = financial return)

IHEP partnership advantage:
├─ Individual financial empowerment integrated with healthcare stability
├─ Outcomes measurable: Emergency fund attainment, credit score improvement, income growth
├─ Health correlation: Financial stability linked to medication adherence, healthcare engagement
├─ Brand differentiation: "CDFIs advancing health equity through financial inclusion"
├─ Market validation: Growing focus on social determinants of health (SDOH)

NEXT STEPS

1. Schedule 45-minute exploratory call to discuss fit
2. Review IHEP's current participant base and financial health metrics
3. Model matched savings program for your CDFI's portfolio
4. Identify capital sources and timeline for deployment
5. Negotiate partnership terms and measurement framework

## 2.3 CDFI COLD OUTREACH EMAIL

```
Subject: Innovative Financial Inclusion Partnership - Healthcare & CDFI Collaboration

Hi [CDFI Executive Director / VP of Community Development],

I'm reaching out because I think we have mutual interest in financial inclusion for 
an underserved population: people managing chronic health conditions who experience 
employment discrimination and income volatility.

Here's the situation:

THE PROBLEM:
├─ 129 million Americans have chronic conditions
├─ 40% experience employment disruption after diagnosis
├─ Financial stress directly undermines health (skipping medications, delaying care)
├─ Traditional financial services exclude this population (perceived risk)

THE OPPORTUNITY:
We (IHEP) have 25,000+ participants engaged in digital health platform. Many are 
becoming employed through our training programs and earning stable income—but they 
lack access to affordable banking, emergency credit, and financial guidance.

Your [CDFI] is perfectly positioned to serve this market through:

1. Matched savings programs (build emergency reserves: $2,400+ per person over 2 years)
2. Emergency lending at reasonable rates (10-12% vs. 25%+ payday loans)
3. Financial capability coaching (budgeting, debt, benefits optimization)

THE BUSINESS CASE:

For [CDFI]:
├─ Capital deployment: $600K Year 1 → $1.3M Year 3
├─ Interest revenue: $30K-60K annually (as loan portfolio grows)
├─ Default rate: 12% (vs. 35% industry subprime) because we co-sign + provide financial coaching
├─ Community impact: 500+ individuals build $1.2M+ in assets by Year 3
├─ CRA credit: Significant evidence of community development impact

For IHEP:
├─ Expanded financial support removing barriers to health stability
├─ Shared impact metrics (health outcomes linked to financial stability)
├─ Partnership validation in field (signals institutional credibility)

EXAMPLE:
A 40-year-old participant earning $2,000/month through IHEP peer navigator role:
├─ Saves $100/month through matched savings (24-month program)
├─ [CDFI] matches $100 → Builds $2,400 in emergency fund
├─ Uses emergency fund to cover medical copay (avoids payday loan at 25% APR)
├─ Improves medication adherence (health benefit) + financial stability (economic benefit)

THE ASK:

I'd like to schedule 30-40 minutes to discuss whether this partnership model aligns 
with [CDFI]'s community development strategy. I can share:

├─ Participant financial profiles (anonymized)
├─ Health outcome data linked to financial stability
├─ Financial projections for matched savings + emergency lending
├─ Comparable partnerships we've established with other CDFIs

Would Tuesday 2pm ET, Wednesday 10am ET, or Thursday 3pm ET work for an exploratory call?

Best,
[Your Name]
IHEP | VP of Financial Partnerships
[Phone] | [Email]

P.S. If financial services isn't the right fit for your organization, I'd be grateful 
for an introduction to a CDFI leader who might be exploring innovative health/finance 
integration. We're aiming to pilot this in 3 markets by Q1 2026.
