## SECTION 1: PROJECT NARRATIVE

### 1.1 Statement of Need

The United States faces a critical shortage of healthcare professionals while simultaneously experiencing widespread unemployment and underemployment among individuals with chronic illnesses—a paradox that IHEP's proposal directly addresses.

**The Problem:**
- 129 million Americans have chronic conditions; 40 million are of working age
- HIV/AIDS diagnosis results in 40% employment loss within 12 months
- Traditional workforce development programs exclude individuals with chronic health conditions, viewing them as "unreliable" despite evidence showing people with managed conditions maintain comparable attendance rates
- Healthcare IT shortage: 80,000+ unfilled positions in EHR support, health data analysis, care coordination

**The IHEP Solution:**
IHEP's Healthcare IT Career Pathway integrates three elements federal workforce policy explicitly prioritizes:
1. **Training for high-demand occupations** (healthcare IT, data analysis)
2. **Support services for barrier populations** (people with chronic illnesses)
3. **Employer partnerships with visible job placements**

By combining clinical care management with workforce development, IHEP creates a sustainable pathway from unemployment/underemployment → health stability → meaningful work.

### 1.2 Project Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Prepare 200 individuals with HIV/chronic illnesses for employment in healthcare IT roles, achieving 75% job placement within 6 months of certification.

**Objectives (SMART):**

| Objective | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **O1:** Recruit and enroll 200 participants | 200 enrollments in 24 months | Enrollment logs, eligibility documentation |
| **O2:** Complete certificate training | 160 completions (80% rate) | Course completion records |
| **O3:** Achieve employment | 120 placements (75% of completers) | Employment verification, wage records |
| **O4:** Job retention | 90% retention at 6 months, 75% at 12 months | Quarterly follow-up surveys, employer reports |
| **O5:** Wage outcomes | $35K-45K starting salary for 80% of placed | Wage & tax records, employer verification |
| **O6:** Credential attainment | CompTIA A+, Google IT Support Professional, or equivalent | Industry certification records |

### 1.3 Target Population

**Primary:** Dislocated workers with chronic health conditions, including:
- Individuals diagnosed with HIV who experienced employment disruption
- Healthcare workers (nurses, medical assistants) retargeting to IT roles
- Remote work seekers with health barriers to traditional employment

**Secondary:** Connected populations:
- Underemployed healthcare workers seeking advancement
- Recent TANF recipients transitioning to work

**Demographic Profile:**
- Age: 25-65 (majority 30-50)
- Ethnicity: 60% Black/African American, 25% Hispanic/Latino, 15% other
- Gender: 60% male, 40% female
- Barriers: 100% have chronic health conditions; 70% report financial hardship; 40% long-term unemployment (2+ years)

**Justification for Target Population:**
This population faces systematic exclusion from traditional IT training programs despite strong motivation and capability. People with chronic conditions:
- Show **higher commitment** to training (view it as life-changing opportunity)
- Demonstrate **superior attendance** (80-90% vs. 70% general population average per ATD Research)
- Achieve **faster credential acquisition** (self-directed, motivated learners)

# APPLICATION #3: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION GRANT
## Ford Foundation - Building Equitable Futures
**Program:** Economic Opportunity  
**Amount Requested:** $400,000  
**Project Period:** 24 months

### Program Narrative

**Foundation Priority Alignment:**
The Ford Foundation's Economic Opportunity initiative supports "expanding opportunities for people to secure decent work and economic well-being." IHEP's Income Generation Initiative directly advances this mission by:

1. **Breaking Barriers to Employment:** Removing health-related employment stigma through dignified peer support
2. **Building Economic Resilience:** Creating multiple income streams enabling financial stability
3. **Advancing Equity:** Specifically targeting historically excluded populations (people with HIV, chronic illnesses, racial/ethnic minorities)
4. **Data-Driven Impact:** Demonstrating outcomes through rigorous measurement

**IHEP's Unique Approach:**
Unlike traditional workforce development (which separates healthcare from economics), IHEP integrates clinical care with career opportunity. Participants simultaneously:
- Receive evidence-based healthcare management
- Build financial literacy and economic planning capacity
- Access genuine employment pathways with living wages
- Join supportive peer communities reducing stigma

**Project Goals:**
1. Serve 400 participants across 24 months (NYC, LA, Chicago pilots)
2. Generate $8.2M in direct + indirect financial benefit for participants
3. Create sustainable employment income ($35K+ average placement wage)
4. Document outcomes demonstrating economic dignity + health improvement

**Budget Breakdown:**
```
Program Implementation            $250,000
├─ Peer navigator training (50 positions @ $3K each)
├─ Career pathway development
├─ Community partnership building
└─ Cultural adaptation (communities of color emphasis)

Research & Evaluation           $80,000
├─ Rigorous outcome measurement
├─ Community-based participatory research
├─ Equity-focused analysis (race, gender, age)
└─ Dissemination to field

Technical Assistance            $40,000
├─ Field building support
├─ Other sites learning from IHEP
├─ Toolkit/curriculum development
└─ Peer learning exchange

Administration & Overhead       $30,000
```

# APPLICATION #4: NIH SMALL BUSINESS SBIR/STTR GRANT
## Phase II: Healthcare IT Workforce Ecosystem
**NIH SBIR/STTR:** Phase II Industrial Research  
**Amount Requested:** $850,000  
**Project Period:** 24 months  
**Goal:** Develop & validate digital platform supporting income generation

### Research Plan

**Specific Aims:**

**Aim 1: Develop Integrated Financial Health Twin Module**
- Extend IHEP's digital twin architecture to include financial data
- Create AI-powered income opportunity matching engine
- Integrate with benefits database (real-time eligibility checking)
- Outcome: Production-ready module enabling 1,000+ participants

**Aim 2: Validate Income-Health Correlation**
- RCT: 400 participants randomized to immediate vs. delayed income support
- Primary outcome: Medication adherence (viral suppression in HIV cohort)
- Secondary outcomes: Mental health, employment, financial stability
- Hypothesis: Income stability improves medication adherence by 25%

**Aim 3: Demonstrate Health Economics ROI**
- Calculate cost-per-QALY (quality-adjusted life year)
- Compare to standard digital health platforms
- Model 5-year return on investment for payers/health systems
- Outcome: Health economics analysis supporting reimbursement case

**Significance:**
This research addresses fundamental gap: while digital health improves clinical outcomes, failure to address financial SDOH limits effectiveness. This work demonstrates integrated model works better + costs less.

**Innovation:**
First study combining digital therapeutics (clinical) + digital financial empowerment (economic) in unified intervention. Rigorous measurement of income-health correlation in controlled setting.
