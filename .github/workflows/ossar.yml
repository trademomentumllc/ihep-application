# OSSAR is deprecated and does not support this repository's stack (JavaScript/TypeScript and Python).
# Keep this workflow as a no-op so manual runs succeed without surfacing tool errors in the Security tab.
# CodeQL at .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml is the supported static analysis workflow.
