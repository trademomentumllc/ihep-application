# WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT APPLICATION
IHEP Peer Navigator Employment & Health Technology Career Pipeline

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Integrated Health Empowerment Program (IHEP) requests $1,200,000 in WIOA funding to launch a comprehensive Peer Navigator Employment & Health Technology Career Pipeline serving 300 individuals living with chronic conditions (primarily HIV/AIDS) over 24 months. This innovative program addresses a critical workforce gap—the shortage of culturally competent healthcare navigators and health IT professionals—while simultaneously creating sustainable career pathways for a population experiencing 45% unemployment rates and significant barriers to traditional employment.
### Program Innovation
Unlike traditional workforce development programs, IHEP integrates employment training directly into a digital health platform, creating a work-while-you-learn model where participants:
1. Earn immediate income ($600–1,100/month) through platform-based micro-tasks during training
2. Develop industry-recognized skills in healthcare navigation, health informatics, and digital health technology
3. Transition to stable employment as peer navigators ($28K–72K annually) or health IT roles ($45K–85K annually)
4. Improve health outcomes through reduced financial stress and peer support (35% medication adherence improvement documented)
### Measurable Outcomes (24-Month Targets)
